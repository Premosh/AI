Fuzzy logic is a form of reasoning that deals with approximate values rather than fixed and exact ones. It allows for more flexible and intuitive decision-making, similar to how humans think and make decisions based on imprecise information. Here are the key concepts:

Key Concepts of Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy Sets: Unlike classical sets where an element either belongs or doesn't belong to a set, fuzzy sets allow for degrees of membership. An element can partially belong to a set to varying degrees between 0 and 1.
For example, a person can be 0.8 "tall" and 0.4 "short".

Membership Functions: These functions define how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value between 0 and 1.
For instance, a membership function for "tall" might gradually increase from 0 to 1 as height increases from 5 feet to 6.5 feet.

Fuzzy Rules: These are if-then statements that use fuzzy logic to map inputs to outputs.
Example: "If the temperature is high, then the fan speed should be high."

Fuzzification: This process converts crisp (precise) input values into fuzzy values using membership functions.
Example: Converting a temperature reading of 72Â°F into a fuzzy value for "warm".

Inference: Using the fuzzy rules, the system processes the fuzzy inputs to determine the fuzzy outputs.
Example: Combining fuzzy values for "warm" and "high humidity" to determine the fuzzy value for "fan speed".

Defuzzification: This process converts the fuzzy output values back into crisp values to provide a concrete decision or action.
Example: Converting the fuzzy value for "fan speed" into an actual speed setting like 3.

### 1. **Problem Context**
- The goal is to determine how much water (irrigation) to provide to plants based on two input factors: soil moisture and sunlight intensity.
- Fuzzy logic is used because it allows for handling imprecise or uncertain information, which is common in real-world scenarios.

### 2. **Input Variables**
   - **Soil Moisture**:
     - Fuzzy sets defined for soil moisture:
       - `very_dry`, `dry`, `optimal`, `wet`, and `very_wet`.
     - Soil moisture is measured on a scale from 0 to 100 (where 0 is very dry and 100 is very wet).
   - **Sunlight Intensity**:
     - Fuzzy sets defined for sunlight:
       - `very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `very_high`.
     - Sunlight intensity is measured on a scale from 0 to 100 (where 0 is very low and 100 is very high).

### 3. **Output Variable**
   - **Irrigation Level**:
     - Fuzzy sets defined for irrigation:
       - `very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `very_high`.
     - The irrigation level represents how much water to provide to the plants.

### 4. **Fuzzy Rules**
   - A set of rules connects the input variables (soil moisture and sunlight) to the output (irrigation level).
   - Example rules:
     - If soil is very dry and sunlight is very low, then irrigation is medium.
     - If soil is very dry and sunlight is high, then irrigation is very high.
     - Similar rules cover all possible combinations.

### 5. **Fuzzy Inference System**
   - The rules are combined into a fuzzy inference system.
   - When given specific soil moisture and sunlight values, the system applies the rules to determine the appropriate irrigation level.

### 6. **Testing the System**
   - The code tests the system with specific input values:
     - Soil moisture: 40 (interpreted as dry)
     - Sunlight intensity: 70 (interpreted as high)
   - The system computes the irrigation level based on these inputs and the defined rules.

### 7. **Visualization**
   - The code generates visual graphs to illustrate how the inputs (soil moisture and sunlight) are mapped to the output (irrigation level).

### 8. **Running the Code**
   - When you execute this code, it simulates the fuzzy logic system and provides a recommendation for irrigation based on the given inputs.

### Simplified Explanation
1. **Inputs**: You measure soil moisture and sunlight.
2. **Rules**: Based on these measurements, rules decide how much to water the plants.
3. **System**: The system combines the rules and decides the irrigation level.
4. **Output**: You get a recommendation for irrigation.
